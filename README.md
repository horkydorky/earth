Of course. A great `README.md` is the final, crucial step to showcase your incredible work. It's your project's front door.

Here is a complete, professional `README.md` file tailored specifically for your project. I have included sections that explain the "what," the "why," and the "how," and I've used Markdown formatting to make it look clean and impressive.

### **Your Action: Create and Populate `README.md`**

1.  In the root directory of your `earth` project (alongside `app.py`), create a new file named `README.md`.
2.  **Copy the entire block of text below** and paste it into your new `README.md` file.
3.  **Crucial Step:** You will need to take a screenshot of your working Streamlit application (showing the Kathmandu heatmap) and add it to your project. I've marked the exact spot where you need to insert it.

# üåç EarthPulse: NDVI Vegetation Analysis

**EarthPulse** is a powerful data science application built to transform raw NASA satellite imagery into meaningful, interactive vegetation heatmaps. Developed as a solo project for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, this tool provides an accessible way to monitor the health and density of plant life anywhere on Earth.

This project's first case study focuses on generating a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) map for **Kathmandu, Nepal**, showcasing the contrast between the urban valley and the lush surrounding hills.

## üõ∞Ô∏è The Science: What is NDVI?

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a critical scientific metric used to analyze remote sensing data and assess the health of vegetation. The formula is simple but powerful:

**NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)**

Where `NIR` is the reflectance in the Near-Infrared spectrum and `Red` is the reflectance in the visible red spectrum. Healthy, dense vegetation strongly reflects NIR light and absorbs red light, resulting in a high NDVI value. Urban areas, rock, or water result in low values.

Our application automates the entire process of calculating NDVI from raw satellite bands and visualizes it as an intuitive green heatmap, where brighter green indicates healthier vegetation.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Interactive UI:** A clean and simple web interface built with Streamlit.
-   **Dynamic Data Processing:** Select any region and year, and the backend engine will intelligently search for the corresponding data files.
-   **Scientific Accuracy:** Utilizes a robust Python pipeline with `rasterio`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to perform accurate NDVI calculations.
-   **NASA Data Integration:** Directly processes high-quality **Landsat 8/9 Collection 2 Level-2** data from the official NASA/USGS EarthExplorer portal.
-   **Localized & Scalable:** Easily scalable to process data for any location on Earth simply by adding the required satellite data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   An active virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/earth.git
    cd earth
    ```

2.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Acquire Data:**
    -   This application requires raw Landsat 8/9 satellite data (`.tif` files for Red and NIR bands).
    -   Download your desired data from [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/).
    -   Place the files in the `data/ndvi/raw/` directory, named according to the convention:
        -   `<region>_<year>_red.tif`
        -   `<region>_<year>_nir.tif`
    -   *Sample data for `kathmandu_2023` and `amazon_2022` is included in the repository.*

### Running the Application

1.  Make sure your terminal is in the project's root directory.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3.  Your web browser will automatically open to the application's UI. Use the sidebar to select your desired region and year, then click "Generate Heatmap".

## üåü Future Work

-   **Time-Series Comparison:** Implement a side-by-side view to compare NDVI maps from two different years, visually highlighting environmental change.
-   **Glacier & Temperature Pipelines:** Expand the application to include new data modules for monitoring glacier retreat and temperature anomalies.
-   **Caching:** Implement a caching mechanism to instantly serve previously generated heatmaps, improving performance.
